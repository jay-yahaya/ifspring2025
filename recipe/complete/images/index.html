            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350°F / 175°C.</li>
                
                <li>Add 1 3/4 cups of Biscoff cookie crumbs, 5 Tbsp granulated sugar and 6 Tbsp melted butter into a medium bowl. Mix together until the ingredients are combined and the cookie crumbs look moist.</li>
                
                <li>Pour the cookie mixture into a 9-inch springform pan. Use the back of a spoon or the bottom of a measuring cup to press down firmly and create a compact, even crust covering the bottom of the pan and reaching about halfway up the sides of the pan.</li>
                
                <li>Bake for 8 minutes then remove from the oven. Place the pan on a wire rack to cool.</li>
                
                <li>Keep your oven on but reduce the temperature to 325°F / 165°C.</li>
                
                <div class="step-note">
                    <p>While the cookie crust bakes and cools make the cheesecake filling.</p>
                </div>
                
                <li>Place 5 cups of room temperature cream cheese in a large bowl. Beat with a hand mixer or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment on a low speed until creamy and smooth.</li>
                
                <li>Add in 1 1/2 cups of sugar, 1/2 cup room temperature sour cream, 1/4 cup cookie butter, 1 Tbsp vanilla extract and 1 Tbsp ground cinnamon. Mix on a medium-low speed until combined, scraping the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed.</li>
                
                <li>Crack 4 large eggs into a separate bowl and mix together with a fork until scrambled. Slowly mix the eggs into the cream cheese mixture on a medium-low speed. Mix just until the eggs are incorporated.</li>
                
                <li>Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula then mix on a low speed as needed to ensure the ingredients are fully combined and that the batter is smooth. Gently bang your mixing bowl on your counter a few times to help release any trapped air bubbles, which can cause your cheesecake to crack.</li>
                
                <li>Pour the cheesecake filling on top of the cooled cookie crust and bake at 325°F / 165°C for 30 minutes.</li>

                <li>Reduce the oven temperature to 250°F / 120°C and bake for an additional 45 minutes.</li>
            
                <li>Once the cheesecake is fully baked, turn the oven off but leave your cheesecake in the oven to cool for another 30 minutes WITHOUT OPENING THE DOOR. I know it's hard not to peek, but it's important that all that heat stays in the oven to let it to slowly cool. This minimizes the temperature shock and prevents your cheesecake from cracking.</li>
                
                <li>After 30 minutes of cooling, crack your oven door open with a wooden spoon and let the cheesecake cool in the oven for another hour.</li>
                
                <li>Next, remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it continue to cool at room temperature for 2 hours. Once it's reach room temperature, cover the top of the cheesecake with plastic wrap and refrigerate the cheesecake for an additional 3-4 hours or overnight.</li>
                
                <li>When you're ready to enjoy this Biscoff cheesecake, remove it from the fridge and carefully release the collar of the springform pan.</li>
                
                <li>Drizzle warm cookie butter over the top of cheesecake and top with whipped cream swirls. Use a sharp, warm knife to cut into the chilled cheesecake. Clean the knife after each cut to get perfect slices.</li>

                <h3>Making This Biscoff Cheesecake in Advance:</h3>
                <p>This cheesecake can be stored in the fridge for up to a week. Store slices in an airtight container or cover the springform pan tightly with plastic wrap to keep it fresh. If you're making this cheesecake in advance, wait to garnish it with melted cookie butter and whipped cream until you plan to serve it.</p>
                
                <h3>The Toothpick Test:</h3>
                <p>The first is the toothpick test. Once you turn off the oven, insert a toothpick into the cheesecake 1-inch from the edge of the pan. If it comes out clean, your cheesecake is done baking.</p>
