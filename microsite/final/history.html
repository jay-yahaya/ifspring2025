                            <p>The Rubik's Cube began its journey in 1974 when Hungarian architecture professor Ernő Rubik created the first working prototype. 
                                Originally called the "Magic Cube," Rubik designed it as a three-dimensional teaching tool to help his students understand 
                                spatial relationships and movement. What's remarkable is that Rubik didn't initially realize he had created a puzzle—it was only
                                after scrambling his creation and attempting to restore it that he discovered the challenge that would captivate the world.</p>

                            <p>The cube remained relatively unknown outside Hungary until 1979, when businessman Tibor Laczi discovered it at a Budapest convention
                                and brought it to the attention of toy specialist Tom Kremer. Recognizing its potential, Kremer convinced the Ideal Toy Company
                                to distribute the puzzle internationally. In 1980, the "Magic Cube" was renamed "Rubik's Cube" and began its global journey.</p>
